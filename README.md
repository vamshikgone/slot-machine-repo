This is my first project using python.
I have written a code for a slot machine which depicts a real world gambling slot machine with less complexity.
It keeps track of the user deposit and returns the earnings or losses based on the winnings and losses.

This README files explains the various git commands I have used for the first time to commit the code to the git on my local system and then push it to my Git Hub account.


# Explain

First create a folder in your local computer using a text editor and add the .py file to that folder.
Now add the related README files to the same folder.
Now using the terminal inside the code editor move the diretory to the newly created folder here we have all the code.
Now initialize a empty git repository using > git init < command.
Now use the command > git status < it says nothing added to the repo but untracked files present. Basically it is saying that there two files (code and README) while are found in the folder but they need to be added.
Using the command > git add . < add two files to the repo.
Check the status using > git status < command.
